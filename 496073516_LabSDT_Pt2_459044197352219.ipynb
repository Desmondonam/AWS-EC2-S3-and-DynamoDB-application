        "    Ok, so now you have performed the desired analysis for one subject.  You have computed eight numbers for that subject described above.  Now we want to repeat this for each subject. There are two ways to do this.  One is using the pandas groupby() function.  This is somewhat of the advanced mode version but if you do this you can probably perform the analysis in only 5-6 lines of code.  An alternative approach is to generalize the code you just wrote to use a for loop that iterates over each subject in the data frame.  Which ever way you choose you might find it helpful to refer to the <a href=\"http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall19/labincp/tips/fortyforloops.html\">Forty For Loops</a> notebook I provided which shows some example templates for using for loops to analyze individual subject data in pandas dataframes.  The end result is that you want a dataframe containing the d' and c' for each subject for each stimulus condition.\n",
